Inspired by the latest WordPress XSS forced patch, I've migrated over to Jekyll for my personal blog.  I had mentioned possibly using something other than Jekyll in my related blog post [here](/devops/jekyll-and-git-hooks).  Originally I was concerned about moving WordPress content to Jekyll but I found (this blog post to be very helpful)[http://blog.8thcolor.com/en/2014/05/migrate-from-wordpress/].

I look forward to writing my next article in markdown.  Tomorrow I'm going to Bsides in Cincinnati so maybe I'll be inspired to write something.
