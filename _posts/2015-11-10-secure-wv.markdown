This weekend I attended [SecureWV](http://securewv.com/) (previously Hackercon) for the first time.  It was very informative.  Though I missed the first day, there was an excellent presentation on Physical Security and a Python workshop.  I look forward to going next year.

Most importantly, on the way back, we made a stop by Hillbilly Hot Dogs.  I ordered a homewrecker, but I couldn't finish it in one sitting.

Here are some pictures:
